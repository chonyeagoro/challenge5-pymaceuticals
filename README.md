# challenge5-pymaceuticals

The goal of this assignment is to use jupyter notebook to make calculations, create tables, and different types of graphs in order to make analytical observations and conclusions. 

Background

You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

Analysis 
- 51% of the mice in the experiment that had tumors were male while the other 49% were female. 
- The bar graph shows that the Capomulin treatment performs the best in terms of reducing the size of tumors with the number of its timepoints being over 200 (somewhere around 240). In addition, Ramicane is the second best treatment after Capomulin with it having somewhere around 235 timepoints. On the other hand, the graph also shows that the least effective treatment is the Propriva with it's timepoints being around 140. 
- On the line graph, it shows that after 20 days, there was a sudden drop in the tumor volume (from 48 mm3 to 44 mm3) with the Capomulin treatment.
- Through the analysis, there is a positive correlation between the weight of the mice and the average tumor volume with the value correlation being 0.84. 
- From the data, tables, and graphs presented, Capomulin and Ramicane are the most effective treatments for reducing the size of tumors.
